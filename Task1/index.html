    <h1>Computer Memory</h1>
    <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A computer is an electronic device that takes raw data as input and,
      processes it, then provides the desired result. It has the potential to
      execute programmed computations quickly and with great accuracy. Put in
      another way, the computer receives input such as data and stores it
      together with instructions in memory (use them when required). The data is
      then processed and converted into valuable information. After that, it
      provides the result according to the inputs. Here, input means the
      unprocessed data that we want the machine to handle and then give us a
      response, and output refers to the outcome of the machine's processing of
      the unprocessed data, which may include data analysis, searching,
      distributing, storing, and more. Consequently, a computer is also referred
      to as a data processing system. <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer memory holds the data and instructions needed to process raw
      data and produce output. It is the same as a human mind, where data,
      information, and instructions are stored. It is a data storage device or a
      data storage component where instructions for processing data are kept
      along with the data that has to be processed. Both the input and the
      output can be held here. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer memory is divided into large number
      of small parts known as cells. Each cell has a unique address which varies
      from 0 to memory size minus one. Computer memory is of two types: Volatile
      (RAM) and Non-volatile (ROM). The secondary memory (hard disk) is referred
      as storage not memory.
